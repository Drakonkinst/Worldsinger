/* This mixin modifies OverlayTexture to fill unused rows with additional colors. More can be added
 * as needed. Vanilla uses row 3 for the red hurt animation, and row 10 for flashing TNT.
 *
 * If we REALLY need more colors, we can even use individual pixels. This has a higher chance to
 * break though, and we don't need more colors than current.
 *
 * Currently used colors should be documented here:
 * 0 = Midnight Overlay
 * 1 = Midnight Overlay Hurt
 * 3 = Red (default, used when LivingEntity entities are hurt)
 * 10 = White (default, used for TNTEntity flashing)
